# RichMarkdownBoxUWP
A rich text control for Markdown that works with UWP.


Can getMarkdown from the RichEditBox, and you can setMarkdown too. 

The `markdowneditcontrol` gives you basic editor functionality like bold, italic, and markdown headings, while the `richmarkdownbox` control only gives you a `richeditbox` that has `getMarkdown()` and `setMarkdown()` functionality.

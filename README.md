# RichMarkdownBoxUWP
A rich text control for Markdown that works with UWP.


Right now, it only supports going from richtext -> markdown, but I'll have the other way soon. Demo project is included, but it's pretty self explanatory. 

The `markdowneditcontrol` gives you basic editor functionality like bold, italic, and markdown headings, while the `richmarkdownbox` control only gives you a `richeditbox` that has `getMarkdown()` functionality.
